# IRMAseal curve library [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/bls12_381.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/irmaseal_curve)

This crate is a fork of the [BLS12-381 pairing-friendly elliptic curve construction crate](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bls12_381), providing serialisation. This crate is forked because the maintainers of BLS12-381 do not wish to merge the proposed serialisation standard in [merge request #12](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bls12_381/pull/12). This crate should be up to date with upstream, with the `gt-serialisation` branch merged.
